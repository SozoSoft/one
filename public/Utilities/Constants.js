TODO: 
    * 'look around' -> build this out more
        * likely 1. check if area has already been 'look around' in
        * if so, check if sufficient time has passed for more items to have appeared (branches falling, mushrooms growing, etc)
        * if not, randomly generate items based on biome
        * display found items in cli
        * if inventory has space, user may then 'pickup [item]' using either item name, item id#, or * to pick up all
        * if user inventory full, give error
    * cancel() -> add id as a parameter cancel(id)
    * if no parameter passed to cancel, cancel most recent job/action (and pop from list)
    * id -1 would be the last job/action, -2 the second to last, and so on.
    * id 1 would be the first job/action (or maybe id 0, not sure which would be most intuitive for most players)
    * wander -> allow arguments for distance and/or time. (wander 30 - player wanders for 30 seconds)
    * 'list actions' (or something like that) -> new command to list all currently active actions (like ps in bash)
        * maybe call this 'doing' or 'active' or 'in progress'
        * list would provide names, est. time to completion, time running, id (job/action id)
    * 'look around' -> similar to ls in bash
    * inventory -> lists items in your inventory
    * 'pause' -> put an action on hold
    * 'todo [action][index to be inserted at]' -> adds an action to be done after action at previous index completes
        * pushes whatever's currently at that index to the following index
